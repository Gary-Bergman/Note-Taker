  ## Description

 I built this project for users that need to keep track of a lot of information. It's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed.
 
 This project involved the creation of an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application uses an express backend and saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file. To use, see the `Usage` section below.

  ## Usage

  Run the application using the command `node expressServer.js` or `nmp start` in the CLI then go to a browser window and enter `localhost:8080/` to view the home page. Click the `Get Started` button to navigate to the notes page. You can add a note by typing text into the `Note Title` and `Note Text` areas. Click the save icon to save that note. Click the trashcan icon to delete any of your previously saved notes.
